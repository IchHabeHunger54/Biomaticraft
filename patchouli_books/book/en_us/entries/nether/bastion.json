Every bastion has one treasury at most, all other types can generate multiple times.$(br2)Since bastion often appear decayed, if a bastion is above a $(l:fluids/lava)lava$() ocean, a skilled warrior might be able to push the piglins down there through holes in the floor, though they should be careful not to fall down themselves.","type":"text"},{"text":"The treasury is what you will want to go for. Be warned that as soon as you open a $(l:blocks/chest)chest$() or break a gold block, all piglins will get angry at you, even if you wear golden equipment. It is, in general, not recommended to go in there with golden armor, instead, you should simply wipe them out - piglin brutes are way more of a problem than normal piglins are, and you will want to be ready for them.","type":"text"},{"text":"However, the loot is more than worth it. $(l:items/diamond)Diamonds$(), $(l:items/netherite)netherite$(), the $(l:items/music_disc)Pigstep music disc$() and the $(l:items/banner_pattern)Snout banner pattern$() are the main loot besides the gold.","type":"text"}]}
