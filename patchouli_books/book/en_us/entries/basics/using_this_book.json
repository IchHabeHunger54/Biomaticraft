There are three buttons in the bottom left corner that do stuff. The first, Resize UI, is pretty self-explanatory. The second can be clicked on for a reading history, which is explained in detail there. The third is useless for you. It is meant for translators, and this book doesn't have translations.","type":"text"},{"text":"Then, at the top right of this very page, there is a bookmark button. You can add one page there as a bookmark, so that you can access it from anywhere else in this book. Alternatively, you can shift-click the entry to bookmark it as well. Doing the latter allows you to bookmark multiple pages. Shift-click a bookmarked entry to remove the bookmarked entry.","type":"text"},{"text":"Use TAB to jump between buttons, if you're too lazy to use your mouse (which is completely understandable).$(br2)Last but not least, right-clicking anywhere will act as if you clicked on the Back button.$(br2)And that's it already! (Maybe also read what appears when hovering over a button, might help.)","type":"text"}]}
