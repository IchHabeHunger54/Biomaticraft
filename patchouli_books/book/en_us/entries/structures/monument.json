{"category":"patchouli:structures","icon":"minecraft:prismarine_bricks","name":"Monument","pages":[{"text":"Monuments, aka Ocean Monuments or Guardian Temples, are huge underwater structures constructed almost entirely from $(l:blocks/prismarine)prismarine$() and its variants. Monuments are the only place to encounter $(l:mobs/guardian)Guardians$() and Elder Guardians. Each monument has exactly three Elder Guardians, though some of them might have died through other natural influence.","type":"text"},{"text":"The monument is in a U-like shape. In the center of the U lies the entrance, the Sponge Chamber (a room filled with $(l:blocks/sponge)sponges$(), which, aside from $(l:blocks/prismarine)prismarine crystals$(), are the most important reward from the Monument) and one Elder Guardian guarding a treasure of $(l:items/gold)Gold Blocks$() encased in Dark Prismarine.$(br2)The other two Elder Guardians are at the ends of the U. You will want to kill them as well in order to take the sponges or the gold with you.","type":"text"},{"text":"After killing the few Guardians outside the Monument, you can enter through an underwater entrance. It is recommended to bring $(l:effects/potion)water breathing potions$() or another way of breathing underwater in order to actually beat this. When you enter, you will get an Elder Guardian jumpscare and the $(l:effects/haste)Mining Fatigue$() effect, preventing you from simply breaking your way through the structure.","title":"Strategy","type":"text"},{"text":"As a result, you need to dive through the maze and kill all Guardians in your sight. If you get your hands on the sponges when the mining fatigue runs out, use them. Kill all Elder Guardians, then take the sponges, the gold and (if you need them) the sea lanterns with you.","type":"text"}]}
