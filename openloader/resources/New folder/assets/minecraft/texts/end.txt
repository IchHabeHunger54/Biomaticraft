ยง3Thank you for playing the Biomaticraft modpack! I hope you enjoyed it (and will enjoy it further, the games goes on after the dragon battle). Go find an end city, or build the quintuple ore processing complex you have always dreamed of. Play around with the alien ME technology, or battle the true final boss - the mysterious Gaia Guardian. There is still plenty to do.
