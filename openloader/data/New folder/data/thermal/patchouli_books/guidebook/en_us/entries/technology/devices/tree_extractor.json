Can optionally take fertilizer to boost production rate. Bonemeal boosts output by 1.5x for 8 cycles, while $(l:thermal:world/plants/phytogro)phyto-gro$(/l) boosts by 2.0x for 16 cycles. Different trees produce different fluids. Oak, birch, spruce, and acacia trees make resin. Jungle trees yield latex. Dark oak trees contain sap.","type":"text"},{"recipe":"thermal:device_tree_extractor","title":"Arboreal Extractor","type":"crafting"},{"text":"$(li)$(l:thermal:technology/augments/fluid_tank)Expanded Tank Construction$(/l)","title":"Augment Compatibility","type":"text"}],"read_by_default":true}
