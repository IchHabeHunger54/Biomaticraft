Brief descriptions are available in a collapsible panel in the GUI of each block. Another panel offers RF information on the block when applicable, such as current and max RF usage. There are also augment, redstone control, and side configuration panels for organizing augments, response to redstone signals, and input/output of the block.","type":"text"},{"text":"By default, machines come with a blank side configuration when first placed, meaning no sides will accept items or fluids. This can be changed in the Configuration tab. Each side of the block is represented by a square, which will cycle through configurations when clicked. Blue and orange represent input and output, respectively. The arrow buttons configure automatic transfer of items to/from adjacent inventories. Side configurations are saved when the block is picked up.","type":"text"},{"text":"Every machine has a maximum rate at which it can use RF, and every recipe a certain RF cost associated with it. These two values, which may be affected by $(l:thermal:technology/augments/introduction)augments$(/l), can be divided to determine the speed at which a given recipe will be processed. This means that, in order to speed up a machine's operation, either the rate of RF usage can be increased using $(l:thermal:technology/augments/machine_speed)augments$(/l) or the RF needed for a recipe can be decreased using $(l:thermal:items_and_xfer/materials/catalysts)catalysts$(/l).","type":"text"},{"recipe":"thermal:machine_frame","text":"These pages contain recipes for common components in machines and devices.
